            <h3>Trip Highlights</h3>

            <p>
                Fire Island felt like stepping out of my own life for a moment. The ferry ride alone set the tone — just
                water, wind, and that quiet sense that something in you is about to shift. When I arrived, the island
                greeted me with open stretches of sand and air that tasted clean in a way I didn’t realize I’d been
                missing. Everything moved slower there, almost like time was trying to give me room to breathe again.

                The mornings were my favorite. I’d wake up before the sun, wander toward the shoreline, and just watch
                the sky slowly open up. There’s something grounding about that moment when the light hits the water —
                like the world is reminding you that it still knows how to be gentle. Walking along the boardwalks,
                surrounded by dunes and that soft coastal silence, I felt more present than I have in a long time.

                Climbing the Fire Island Lighthouse was its own little journey. Each step felt heavier than it
                should’ve, but when I reached the top, everything made sense. The view stretched out forever — ocean,
                sky, horizon blending like they were made from the same breath. It was one of those moments where you
                don’t say anything, because words would ruin it. Just… stillness.

                Evenings carried a different kind of calm. The island settled into this soft glow — bikes passing by,
                families heading home, the sound of waves folding into the night. It all felt distant from reality in
                the best way. Fire Island doesn’t just give you a break; it gives you space to feel everything you’ve
                been too busy to notice. If you ever need a quiet escape that feels both grounding and a little
                cinematic, this is the place.
